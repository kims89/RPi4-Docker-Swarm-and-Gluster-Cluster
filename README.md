# RaspberryPi Cluster
Background for the project is to document all of the details of the setup. I want a container solution for PiHole, Homebridge and other nifty stuff for home usage. The setup contains of three Raspberry Pi 4 with 4 GB RAM. I must emphasize that this is not a how-to/DIY thing, but if you find some of this useful - Awesome!

## Setup Raspberry Pi (This part is for all of the PIes
1. I decided i just stick with Raspberry Pi OS Lite. https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/
2. ++++ Burn it over to a SD card and all of that ++++
3. Add a ssh-file to the root of the filesystem.
